# Bluetooth RFCOMM Setup for /dev/rfcomm0

This guide explains how to bind a Bluetooth serial device to `/dev/rfcomm0` so it can be accessed from Python or other applications.

---

## ðŸ§­ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Find the Bluetooth MAC Address

1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   bluetoothctl
   ```
2. Inside the `bluetoothctl` prompt, execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   power on
   agent on
   scan on
   ```
3. Look for output like:
   ```
   [NEW] Device 98:D3:31:70:XX:XX SriTu Hobby
   ```
4. Take note of the MAC address (e.g., `98:D3:31:70:XX:XX`).

---

### 2. Pair and Trust the Device

1. Still in `bluetoothctl`, run the following commands:
   ```bash
   pair 98:D3:31:70:XX:XX
   trust 98:D3:31:70:XX:XX
   connect 98:D3:31:70:XX:XX
   ```
2. Type `exit` to leave `bluetoothctl`.

---

### 3. Bind the RFCOMM Port

1. Run the following command in the terminal to bind the Bluetooth device to `/dev/rfcomm0`:
   ```bash
   sudo rfcomm bind 0 98:D3:31:70:XX:XX
   ```
   Replace `98:D3:31:70:XX:XX` with your actual MAC address.

---

### 4. Confirm the Device Exists

1. Check if `/dev/rfcomm0` has been created:
   ```bash
   ls /dev/rfcomm*
   ```
2. You should see:
   ```
   /dev/rfcomm0
   ```

---

### 5. Run Your Python Script

You can now use `/dev/rfcomm0` in your Python script with `pyserial` or any serial communication library.

---

## ðŸ§¼ Optional: Unbind Later

To release the RFCOMM port when done, run:
```bash
sudo rfcomm release 0
```

---

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

- If you see `No such file or directory: '/dev/rfcomm0'`, repeat the binding steps.
- Make sure your device is powered on and in range.
- Use `bluetoothctl devices` to list known devices.
